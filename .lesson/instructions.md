# Final Project Milestone II
The most important aspect of this milestone is that you have a PostgreSQLÂ database designed, created, and that your website interacts with it. Improvements to yourÂ website, based on previous feedback, should be incorporated into the website.

Upload the database schema - a list of tables, and for eachÂ table,Â column types and a brief description. Use bit.io's formatting.

Also, upload a to do-list list of items you have left to complete (as an ordinary .docx or .txt file). Those tasks should be mapped to at least 1 of the criteria listed in the original assignment, and reproduced here for your convenience.Â 

**To-Do List**

ðŸŸ¨need to add alt text to images so they can be read by screen readers \[criterion # 1\]

ðŸŸ¨ need to choose better fonts \[2\]

ðŸŸ¨ need to find unpixelated images \[2\]

ðŸŸ¨ need to make pages more responsive \[3\]

ðŸŸ¨ need to test on Firefox \[3\]

ðŸŸ¨ need to make navigation easier \[4\]

...

**Criteria:**  
Your final website will be graded on the following criteria:

1.  Adherence to commonly recognized principles and guidelines for good web development and design as described in the text and in class.
2.  A website that is appealing to the eye -- suitable choice of colors, shapes, pictures, fonts,  
    white space, all nicely laid out, with a consistent look-and-feel across all pages.
3.  A website that looks good on popular web browsers, and be responsive - it should look good on either a large screen or a small one.
4.  Navigation should be obvious / easy to use
5.  The inclusion of multiple images
6.  Verifiability. All pages must have a discretely placed link to the appropriate w3c verifiers.
7.  A functional form that does something.
8.  The ability to upload a file for some relevant reason (e.g., a music site, you can upload a demo song to)
9.  The ability to connect to a SQL database and perform the usual operations -- insert, update, delete and select on some data of your choosing.
10.  Your website should be dynamic, and use Fetch to retrieve data from a website
11.  There should be the ability to authenticate to the website, and an authenticated user must be able to do something that a non-authenticated user could not do. Sessions should be a part of this.
12.  Include a disclaimer at the bottom of each page that states: This site is under development by UW-Oshkosh students as a prototype for (INSERT ORG HERE). Nothing on the site should be construed in any way as being connected with or representative of (INSERT ORG HERE).Â 

**Deliverables:**

*   Upload your schema here.
*   Upload a screenshot (unzipped - e.g., png or jpg) or a short video walkingÂ through the site
*   Upload your website to the new replit.com project (milestone II)
